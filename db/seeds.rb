# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

introduce: `a Ruby on Rails developer with more than 4 years of experience developing websites.
            I have a good understanding of database design and high load balancing. I enjoy solving problems.
            I enjoy exercising and tracking my habits to improve them over time.
            I believe that anyone can become talented if they believe in themselves.
            I enjoy reading books and finding new ideas from them.
            My coworkers say that I am a good team player and that I help keep the team happier and
            less stressed when a release is coming.`
